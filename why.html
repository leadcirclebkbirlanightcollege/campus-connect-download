      <h2>1. The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        In our college, multiple two-credit certificate courses are conducted each academic term to enhance students’ academic and professional exposure.
        While academically valuable, the operational execution of these courses remained heavily manual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Attendance was recorded on physical hard-copy sheets and later transferred manually into Excel spreadsheets.
        This process was time-consuming, error-prone, and required repeated coordination between students, coordinators, and departments.
      </p>
      <p>
        As participation increased, maintaining accuracy, consistency, and timely access to records became increasingly challenging,
        leading to administrative strain and information gaps.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="content-block">
      <h2>2. The Idea</h2>
      <p>
        Experiencing this workflow firsthand highlighted that the issue was not limited to attendance,
        but rather the absence of a centralized and verified digital system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea behind Campus Connect was to introduce a single platform that could streamline academic coordination,
        beginning with certificate course attendance—reducing manual dependency while improving clarity and accountability.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="content-block">
      <h2>3. The Build</h2>
      <p>
        Campus Connect was designed as a student-driven, institution-aligned platform focused on simplicity, reliability, and scalability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system emphasizes centralized data access, structured workflows, and ease of use—ensuring that academic information
        remains accurate, verifiable, and accessible to all stakeholders.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="content-block">
      <h2>4. The Launch</h2>
      <p>
        What began as a solution to a specific operational challenge evolved into a broader initiative for improving campus communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Campus Connect represents a step towards modernizing institutional processes through technology,
        while maintaining transparency, efficiency, and student-centric design.
