  <h1>Why Campus Connect Exists</h1>
  <p>
    A real academic problem, approached with a structured digital solution.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="why-article">

  <article>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      In our college, multiple two-credit certificate courses are conducted each academic
      term. Attendance for these courses is recorded on hard-copy sheets and later manually
      entered into Excel files.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires repeated coordination,
      making scalability and accuracy difficult as participation increases.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>The Idea</h2>
    <p>
      The lack of a centralized digital system highlighted the need for a reliable platform
      that could streamline attendance and academic coordination.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>The Build</h2>
    <p>
      Campus Connect was developed as a student-driven initiative focused on clarity,
      accuracy, and institutional alignment.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>The Launch</h2>
    <p>
      What began as a solution to attendance management evolved into a broader platform
      aimed at improving campus communication and transparency.
