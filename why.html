  <h1>Why Campus Connect Exists</h1>
  <p class="why-subtitle">
    Not just an app — a response to a real problem faced by students every day.

<!-- STORY -->
<section class="why-story">

  <div class="story-card">
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Campus communication had become fragmented. Academic notices, event updates,
      and official announcements were scattered across WhatsApp groups, notice boards,
      and unofficial channels — leading to confusion, delays, and missed information.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="story-card highlight">
    <h3>A Student’s Experience</h3>
    <p>
      As a student, I experienced this gap firsthand. Important updates were often
      received late or lost among informal messages. There was no single, reliable
      source students could trust for verified campus information.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="story-card">
    <h3>The Vision</h3>
    <p>
      Campus Connect was designed to introduce a centralized, verified digital platform
      for campus communication. The goal was clarity, accountability, and timely access
      to information — not noise.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="story-card">
    <h3>What It Represents</h3>
    <p>
      Today, Campus Connect stands for a more transparent, connected, and
      student-centric campus experience — where information is authentic,
      accessible, and efficiently delivered.
