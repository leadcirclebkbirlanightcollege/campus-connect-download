<!-- ARTICLE -->
<section class="why-article">

  <p>
    Campus Connect was conceived from a recurring challenge observed within the college
    ecosystem—fragmented communication. Academic notices, event updates, and official
    announcements were often distributed across multiple informal platforms, resulting
    in confusion, missed updates, and delayed information for students.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a student, I experienced this issue firsthand. Important updates were frequently
    circulated through unofficial channels, making it difficult to verify authenticity
    and relevance. This lack of a centralized system highlighted the need for a reliable
    and institution-aligned communication platform.
  </p>

  <p>
    Campus Connect was designed to address this gap by introducing a single, verified
    digital space for campus communication. The objective was not merely to develop an
    application, but to establish a structured and dependable system that ensures clarity,
    accountability, and timely access to information.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, Campus Connect represents a step towards a more transparent, connected, and
    student-centric campus experience—where information is accessible, authentic, and
    efficiently delivered to every stakeholder.
