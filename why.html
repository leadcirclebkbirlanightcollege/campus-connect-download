  <h2>Why Campus Connect Exists</h2>

  <p class="story">
    Campus Connect was conceived from a simple but persistent problem observed within our college ecosystem—fragmented communication.
    Important academic notices, event updates, and official announcements were often scattered across multiple platforms, leading to
    confusion, delays, and missed information for students.
  </p>

  <p class="story">
    As a student, I experienced this firsthand. Campus Connect was designed to address this gap by creating a single, verified, and
    reliable digital platform for campus communication. The objective was not merely to build an application, but to establish a
    structured system that promotes clarity, accountability, and timely access to information.
  </p>

  <p class="story">
    Campus Connect represents a step towards a more connected, transparent, and student-centric campus experience.
