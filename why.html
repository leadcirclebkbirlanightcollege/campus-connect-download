  <h1>Why Campus Connect Exists</h1>
  <p class="why-subtitle">
    A first-hand perspective from the founder on the problem that inspired Campus Connect.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="why-article">

  <p>
    Campus Connect was conceived from a simple but persistent problem observed within our
    college ecosystem—fragmented communication. Important academic notices, event updates,
    and official announcements were often scattered across multiple platforms, leading to
    confusion, delays, and missed information for students.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a student, I experienced this challenge firsthand. Critical updates were frequently
    shared through unofficial channels, making it difficult to distinguish verified
    information from informal circulation. This lack of structure directly affected clarity
    and accountability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Campus Connect was designed to address this gap by creating a centralized, verified,
    and reliable digital platform for campus communication. The goal was not just to build
    an application, but to introduce a system that institutions and students can trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    Campus Connect represents a step towards a more transparent, connected, and
    student-centric campus experience—where information is authentic, accessible, and
    efficiently delivered.
