  <h1>Why Campus Connect Exists</h1>
  <p class="why-subtitle">
    A first-hand perspective on the problem that inspired Campus Connect.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="why-article">

  <p>
    Campus Connect was conceived from a simple but persistent problem observed within our
    college ecosystem—fragmented communication. Important academic notices, event updates,
    and official announcements were often scattered across multiple platforms, leading to
    confusion, delays, and missed information for students.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a student, I experienced this challenge personally. Critical updates were frequently
    shared through unofficial channels, resulting in uncertainty and inconsistency. This
    highlighted the need for a single, reliable, and institution-aligned system that students
    could trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    Campus Connect was designed to bridge this gap by providing a centralized digital platform
    for verified campus communication. The objective was not merely to build an application,
    but to establish a structured system that promotes clarity, accountability, and timely
    access to information for every stakeholder.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, Campus Connect represents a step towards a more connected, transparent, and
    student-centric campus experience—where information is accessible, authentic, and
    efficiently delivered.
