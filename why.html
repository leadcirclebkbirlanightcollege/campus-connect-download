  <h1>Why Campus Connect Exists</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    A real campus problem, addressed through a student-led digital initiative.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="why-content">

  <div class="block">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      In our college, multiple two-credit certificate courses are conducted every academic term.
      Attendance for these courses is recorded manually on hard-copy sheets and later transferred
      to Excel files. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to manage at scale.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h2>The Idea</h2>
    <p>
      Repeated exposure to this workflow highlighted the need for a centralized digital system.
      The idea behind Campus Connect was to eliminate fragmented processes and introduce a single,
      reliable platform for academic coordination and communication.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h2>The Build</h2>
    <p>
      Campus Connect was developed with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and institutional alignment.
      The platform aims to reduce manual effort while maintaining transparency and accuracy for
      students and coordinators alike.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h2>The Launch</h2>
    <p>
      What began as a solution to attendance management evolved into a broader initiative to improve
      official campus communication. Campus Connect represents a step towards a more connected and
      efficient academic environment.
